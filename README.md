# n8n-nodes-apple-calendar

This is an n8n community node that allows you to interact with Apple Calendar (iCal).
The node is inspired by the official [Google Calendar node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Calendar).

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Operations

- Calendar: Interact with a selected Calendar.

## Credentials

You need an Apple/iCloud account with an app-specific password set up. The credentials are then made up of the following values:

- iCloud email address (your main iCloud email address, not an alias email address).
- App-specific password

An app-specific password can be created in the [Apple account settings](https://account.apple.com/account/manage). You can find a guide to setting this up [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654).
